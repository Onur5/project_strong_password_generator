## Project Description
The aim is to build a generator that generates personlised strong random password.
In this work it is most important that the generated password is strong (in the line of later defined rules) and has a personal component, so that the individual can remember it.

## Workflow

### Define the rules

#### For the definition of passwords, two specific password-characteristics can be deduced:
    * The password has to be as complex as possible to be hard
    * The password has to be rememberable for the user

#### Rules are orientated on the recommendations of the 'German Federal Office for Information Security':
(https://www.bsi-fuer-buerger.de/BSIFB/DE/Empfehlungen/Passwoerter/passwoerter_node.html)

    * At least 8 figures
    * Use small/big letter, special characters and numbers
    * Do not use simple words that are in wordbooks or names
    * Do not simply append to the beginning or end of a password special characters like '?$%'
    * Combine words by using a special character
    * You should be able to remember it
